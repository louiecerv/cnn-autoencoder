        \nSource: The data consists of features extracted from digitized images of fine needle 
        aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
        \nFeatures: The dataset includes 569 data points, each with 30 numerical features. 
        These features represent various characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as radius, 
        texture, perimeter, and area.
        \nTarget: The target variable indicates the class, whether the tumor is malignant 
        (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). There are 212 malignant cases and 357 benign cases

    An MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) classifier can be used to analyze a heart disease dataset and 
    predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. Here's how it works in this context:
    \nBinary Classification:
    The MLP aims for binary classification, meaning the output will be either 0 (no heart disease) or 1 (heart disease).
    \nData Preprocessing:
    The heart disease dataset contain various features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. 
    These features might need scaling or normalization for the MLP to process them efficiently.
    
    \nMLP Architecture:
    The MLP is a type of artificial neural network with an interconnected layer structure.
    In this case, the input layer will have the size matching the number of features in the heart 
    disease data (e.g., age, blood pressure). There will be one or more hidden layers containing 
    a number of artificial neurons. These hidden layers extract complex patterns from the data.  
    The final output layer will have a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function. 
    This neuron outputs a value between 0 and 1, which is interpreted as the probability of 
    having heart disease (closer to 1) or not (closer to 0).

    \nTraining:
    The MLP is trained using a labeled dataset where each data point has a confirmed classification 
    (heart disease or no disease) associated with its features.
    During training, the MLP adjusts the weights and biases between its artificial neurons to 
    minimize the error between its predicted probabilities and the actual labels in the training data.
    A common training algorithm for MLPs is backpropagation, which calculates the error and propagates 
    it backward through the network to update the weights and biases.
    \nPrediction:
    Once trained, the MLP can predict the probability of heart disease for new, unseen data points 
    based on their features. A threshold is typically set on the output probability (e.g., 0.5). 
    Values above the threshold are classified as having heart disease, while those below are 
    classified as healthy."""
